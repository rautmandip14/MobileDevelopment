•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app is created is an event management app. The goal of the application is to effectively and smoothly manage and organize events. The app will enable user to create, update and manage events efficiently. Major functionalities of the app include:
•	Event creation
•	Notification feature for event update
•	Authentication
•	Attendee management
•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Following features and screens are added to the app in order to support user needs:
•	Login screen: The app offer secure login for authorized access to various features of event management
•	Event dashboard: Show list of upcoming events including, time, date and venue of the event
•	Attendee management: The app can manage attendee list, and can also send invitations
In order to enhance the user experience, clean layout and intuitive navigation is prioritized. To seamlessly guide users through app functionality, consistent typography, visual hierarchy and color scheme is used. 
•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
For coding the app, java programming language is used in Android studio. Key strategies include:
•	Database integration: SQLite is used for storing attendee list, and event details
•	Modularization: For scalability and easier maintenance functionalities are broken into reusable components.
These techniques are important for ensuring scalability, code base efficiency and maintainability.  
•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Physical devices and Android emulator is used for conducting test. Testing includes:
•	Verifying notification triggers
•	Validating registration process and user login
•	Adding, deleting and editing events to know that database operation function seamlessly
Testing ensure that app provide smooth user experience in different versions of Android and met functional requirements.
•	Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
A key innovation include implementation of real-time event updates and notifications. This require synchronization with server side APIs and effective background task handling. 
•	In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I demonstrate knowledge, skills and experience in:
•	User authentication
•	Asynchronous programming
•	Database management
Additionally, event management system, notification system, and robust event creating functionalities showcased user-friendly mobile app solution.
